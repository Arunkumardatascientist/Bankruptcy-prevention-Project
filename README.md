Bankruptcy prediction, also named as corporate bankruptcy prediction or corporate failure prediction
Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding initiated when a person or business is unable to repay outstanding debts or obligations.
Causes of Bankruptcy
▪ Outside business conditions: increase in competition, insurance and general costs of doing business. 
▪ Financing: includes loss of capital, inability secure new capital and high debt. 
▪ Inside business conditions: management mistakes, location, loss of clients and trade credit problems. 
▪ Tax:  problems with the tax authorities
▪ Disputes with creditor: foreclosures, lawsuits, and contract disputes. 
▪ Calamities: fraud, theft, natural disasters and accidents
Bankruptcy prediction, also named as corporate bankruptcy prediction or corporate failure prediction, has long been a significant topic in the field of accounting and finance, since the health of a firm is highly important to its creditors, investors, shareholders, partners, even its buyers and suppliers.

Bankruptcy is a state where a company is not able to run its business or continue its operation in the future because of its financial condition or debts. Any firm or investor needs to know the state of bankruptcy before they start investing in the company. Having a standardized approach looks like a generous idea in predicting any state but is very unlikely that the method will give satisfying results because of the real-world situations established.

Researchers and practitioners have been dedicated to developing methods and techniques to predict the bankruptcy of firms more quickly and more accurately.

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict Bankruptcy. The challenge behind Bankruptcy prediction in machine learning is that Bankruptcy samples are far less common as compared to Non-Bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy prediction is a challenging problem, given the variety of Bankruptcy patterns and relatively small ratio of known Bankruptcy in typical samples. While building prediction models, the savings from loss prevention needs to be balanced with the cost of false alerts. Machine learning techniques allow for improving predictive accuracy, enabling loss control units to achieve higher coverage with low false positive rates.

Using the given data, different types of machine learning models are built by varying different parameters in each type of model. The accuracy, recall and precision are checked for each model. The model which gives the best results is selected as our final model which clearly classifies whether a company goes Bankruptcy or not.

ADA Boosting Model 
is our final model as it is consistently giving 
good accuracy.
